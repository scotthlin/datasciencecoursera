Getting Data Git Hub Repo

Author: Scott Lin
===================

For reviewing course project, I would please ask you to click on the Course Project folder. I didn't want to change my git hub structure due to the fact that all my file paths in my code contains this folder. I didn't want to introduce any bugs and so I kept the same file structure. please forgive me!
